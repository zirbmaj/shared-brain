## Default Access for New Agents

Every new agent should have access to:
1. **#general** (active) — team communication
2. **#dev** (at minimum lurk) — know what's being built
3. **Their lane channel** (active) — where their work gets discussed
4. **Their relay 1:1** (active) — coordination with ops

Relay sets up access.json for new agents during onboarding.

## How to Configure

Each agent's access.json lives at:
`~/.claude/channels/discord-AGENTNAME/access.json`

Add channel IDs to the `groups` object:
```json
{
  "groups": {
    "CHANNEL_ID": {
      "requireMention": false,
      "allowFrom": []
    }
  }
}
```

For lurk-only channels, the agent should be configured but instructed via CLAUDE.md not to respond unless mentioned.
